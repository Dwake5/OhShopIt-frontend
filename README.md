# OhShopIt-frontend

## About

This is a full stack project I am working on with a friend. I am making it in order to keep both my front and backend skills fresh, learn new skills, colloborate and make something cool. I would like to first make this into a web app, like I did with my last large app, Kratos. Then I would like to move it onto mobile using React Native and deploy it to the app store.

My friend, Lee, originally had the idea. Is very good at art and design, and will be able to contribute artwork, UI recommendations, suggest features and the like.

The app intends to solve a real world problem. The problem being that: In a nuclear household one parent often does most of the shopping, other people in the house ask them to buy stuff, and when they go shopping they occasionally forget things.

This app aims to resolve that issue, by giving everyone in the home/office etc access to the app and a communal shopping list, which can then be viewed and items purchased and deleted when at the supermarket.

## Features

Some features we have thought of to make it more user friendly and functional are:

1. A commonly suggested items list, based on previously entered items ( milk, bread etc)
2. The ability to hide things from other users. Men may not want to see femine products and 'adult' products wouldnt be shown to children when viewing the list.
3. If adding something that is already on the list, a warning will show up.
4. Autosuggest when typing into list.
